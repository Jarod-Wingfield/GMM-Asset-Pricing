# GMM Estimation for Multifactor Asset Pricing Models

This repository implements **two-stage Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)** estimation and testing for multifactor asset pricing models. I test by using **Fama-French 5 factors** and **25 portfolios (5Ã—5)** as test assets to analyze **price of risk, pricing errors, and risk exposures**.

It includes:

* Two-stage **GMM estimation** with optional Newey-West adjustments
* Linear Factor Models in **Discount Factor Form** with excess returns
* **Cross-sectional regressions** for risk premia (Î») and pricing errors (Î±)
* Computation of **SSQE**, **MAPE**, and **J-statistic**

## Repository Structure

* **`GMM_SDF.py`**
  Implements the **GMM\_Two\_Stage** class, including functions for loading data, estimating factor prices of risk, pricing errors, and cross-sectional regressions.

* **`data`**
  Contains **test asset returns** (25 portfolios) and **Fama-French 5-factor data** sourced from [Ken French Data Library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).

* **`GMM_SDF_main.ipynb`**
  Example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating GMM estimation, risk exposure analysis, and table generation.
